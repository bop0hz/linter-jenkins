### Next (Roadmap)
- Disable host key checking wtih SSH methods.
- Option to use CLI then SSH without SSH keys.
- figure out travis
- figure out tests for other methods/which method for spec tests (and modify config for it)
- use native packages for curl and ssh
- Warning: Permanently added '[127.0.0.1]:2222' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts is caught as exception instead of being ignored; disabling throwonstderr seems to fix this but causes other problems

### 1.0.1
- Capture all errors instead of just first.
- Fix potential issue with linter undefined return.

### 1.0.0
- Initial version ready for wide usage.
