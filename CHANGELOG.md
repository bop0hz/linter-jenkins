### Next (Roadmap)
- Disable host key checking wtih SSH methods.
- figure out travis
- figure out tests for other methods/which method for spec tests (and modify config for it)
- capture more than first error (cannot now because formatting clashes with newline looping)
- use native packages for curl and ssh
- cli ssh -noKeyAuth option?
